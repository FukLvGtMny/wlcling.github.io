# Verses 
The Bible (WLC) contains 23213 verses. They are represented by 23213 `html` files generated by the script `v/script.py` from the file `_data/byword.csv`. Naming example: `/v/1Kings.2.5.html`. Each such page is also identified by its number from 1 to 23213. It can be found in the margin note of the page, white on white background. The previous page can also be accessed at  `/v/8693`.

# Lexicon
The Bible (WLC) contains 426581 words building up a lexicon of 8674+6 distinct items ("Strong's Hebrew lexicon"). These lexical units are numbered from 1 to 8674 except for six functional lexemes numbered as 9000, 9003, 9004, 9005, 9008, 9009. Their pages are generated by the script `w/genStrong.py` from the file `_data/TBESH_formatted.csv`. Naming example: `w/6904.html`. Gloss translation of each verse links it to its glosses.
 
## To do (next steps)

- Beautify syntactic structures' layout
- Beautify lexicon entries' pages
- Allow for export of the gloss translation (html/odt tables, Latex)
- Integrate source marks (`_data/Doc-KJV`)
- Integrate frequent lexicon lists (`_data/pedagogic`)
