Any other morphology dictionary like `mlexicon.csv` gets generated from it using the constitient dictionary such as `morpholex.csv` by the script `MorphologyTranslate.py`. If one wants to change the translation, one needs to:
 - modify the entry in the `morpholex.csv` file
 - regenerate the combined morphology `MorphologyTranslate.py`
 - regenerate interlinear files `../translatoraid.py`
