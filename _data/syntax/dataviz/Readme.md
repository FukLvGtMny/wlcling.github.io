The jupyter notebook `PhraseTreeStats.ipynb` explores the stats of the phrase marked data in the file `BHSA-phrase-data-cleared.csv`.

It generates the alluvial diagram as in `ptype-pfunction.png` and allows for explicite tree-structure nomenclature as in `ptyp-pfunction.html`.

The notebook `ClauseTreeStats.ipynb` produces the same structure for clauses (`BHSA-clause-data-cleared.csv`).
